# FormFlow AI: Next-Gen Formwork Optimization 🏗️⚡

**National Competition Prototype | Sector: CreaTech & Construction 4.0**

FormFlow AI is a data-driven web application engineered to optimize construction formwork logistics, reduce capital outlay, and minimize environmental impact. By ingesting BIM (Building Information Modeling) data, the system provides 4D inventory lifecycle visualization, geometric kitting logic, and carbon offset tracking.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Dynamic Kitting Logic:** Automatically calculates the exact mix of main panels, support props, and fasteners required for specific wall dimensions.
* **4D Temporal Flow Analysis:** Simulates daily site activity and reconditioning buffers to determine true peak inventory demand, preventing over-procurement.
* **Carbon Offset Tracking:** Quantifies environmental savings (in kg of CO2) achieved by reducing the total number of manufactured panels.
* **Design Standardization Analytics:** Identifies dimensional inefficiencies in architectural designs, flagging segments requiring custom timber fillers.
* **Logistics Dispatch:** Generates a daily dispatch manifest for precise on-site deliveries.
